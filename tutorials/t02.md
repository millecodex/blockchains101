## Tutorial 2

### Admin
We will start by covering any of the course administrative details
* Discussion about A1 presentation, scheduled during tutorial time
* Notes (updated here)

### Tasks
1. Group formation for the group project. Refer to the Video Introduction [Canvas link](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/153071/assignments/1108702) to meet your peers. This is an online course which makes it more difficult to interact and engage with each other and also makes it more difficult for us to get to know each other. 

2. SHA256 - Open a terminal window.\
Windows: `windows key + R`, type `powershell`, press enter. Change below where it says `YourString` to your message and paste it in.
```powershell
$stringAsStream = [System.IO.MemoryStream]::new()
$writer = [System.IO.StreamWriter]::new($stringAsStream)
$writer.write("YourString")
$writer.Flush()
$stringAsStream.Position = 0
Get-FileHash -InputStream $stringAsStream | Select-Object Hash
```
OSX: `Command + Space`, type `Terminal`, press enter. Change where it says `my name is Jeff` to your message and paste in
```
echo -n "my name is Jeff" | shasum -a 256
```
3. Find out what encryption your browser site is using. Now check a different site, do you notice any difference?
4. What is the main mathematical difference between RSA and ECC cryptosystems?
5. How would you go about finding the prime factorisation of $1961$?
6. Get started on Assignment 1 questions
   1. Hash Functions
   2. Merkle Trees
   3. Public Key Cryptography
   4. Time Stamping
