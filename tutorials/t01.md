## Tutorial 1

### Admin
We will start by covering some of the course administrative details that were skipped in lecture 1
* Canvas walkthrough
* Notes (updated here)
* Assignment 1 walkthrough
* Communication preferences

### Tasks
1. Video Introduction [Canvas link](https://rmit.instructure.com/courses/153071/assignments/1108702).  This is an online course which makes it more difficult to interact and engage with each other and also makes it more difficult for us to get to know each other. This video introduction will also serve as our outreach to our peers to form groups for the group project.

2. Discussion
3. Q & A
